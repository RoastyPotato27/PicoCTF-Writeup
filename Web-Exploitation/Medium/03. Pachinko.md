**Title:** Pachinko

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Summary (TL;DR):**

Exploiting POST Request with Brute-Force. 

**1. Scope & Setup**

**Target:** http://activist-birds.picoctf.net:PORT/

**Environment:** Local System / PicoCTF VM

**Tools used:** Browser, Burp-Suite(??)

**2. Recon**

We can see a hyperlink in "Server Source", if you click on it, it will download some files on your system related to the 
challenge. Dont click on it, its not that important. (I wasted a lot of time on it)

after launching the session, we are pressented with a "NAND Simulator"

**What are NAND Gates?**
>A NAND gate is a digital logic gate that outputs 0 only when all its inputs are 1, and outputs 1 otherwise.	

```
**NOTE:** This challenge has 2 flags, the first flag we will cover in this writeup, and the second
one in the other one called Pachinko revisited (hard).
```
 
**3. Exploit**

This is the weirdest CTF I have done, i snooped aroudn the website doing basic stuff, obvoiusly I didnt find anything.
So I decided to use burp Suite, but before that I played with the NAND Simulator 2-3 times and to my surprise.
I got the flag thanks to my incredible luck!

With this exact one (dont try it, the sequence changes is random, coz this didnt give flag a second time)

**PROPER WAY**

Open in burpsuite, send a random order in and intercept it.

As we can see, the server is expection JSON to interact with the NAND gate.

So we can try fuzzing it and see if it works!
Send the request to intruder, and make sure u are running on "sniper attack" mode. Wrap our inputs and outputs in the 
squigly thing.

Set Payload type as numbers, between 0 to 100 and start.

When you run the attack, keep an eye out for the ones with a different length than others. Thats our flag.

Note: You will see multiple ones of this length, but dw they all ahve the same flag

**4. Flag**

```
picoCTF{p4ch1nk0_f146_0n3_e947b9d7}
```
**5. References/Credits**

This guy showed the proper way, coz I got the flag on random LOLL.
