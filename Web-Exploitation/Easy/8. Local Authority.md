**Title:** Local Authority

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Summary (TL;DR):**

Exploiting Login Form.

**1. Scope & Setup**

**Target:** http://saturn.picoctf.net:PORT/

**Environment:** Local System

**Tools used:** Browser

**2. Exploit**

After we try to login with random credentials, we get Login Failed. If we check the inspector tab, we can see a javaScript
in the <body> tag.
Understanding the logic behind the login verification process here - we learn that after a successful login, the browser
sends an "adminFormHash" to the server. 
Since we failed the login, we can exploit this logic by manually sending the formhash.
Since the server obeys the javaScript on the Client-Side. So the server lets us through if we just pretend to be logged in.
