**Title:** ScavengerHunt

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Summary (TL;DR):**

Scavenger Hunting for a flag in every corner of website.

**1. Scope & Setup**

**Target:** http://mercury.picoctf.net:39698/

**Environment:** Local System / PicoCTF VM

**Tools used:** Burpsuite, Browser

**2. Exploit**

Same old rinse and repeat, check page source. We found the 1st part of the flag: ```picoCTF{t```.

After that we go to the ```mycss.css``` and find the 2nd part of the flag: ```h4ts_4_l0``` , so far so good.

When we  enter the ```myjs.js``` file, we are presented with a hint:

<img width="497" height="420" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31b239c0-9dcb-4b70-9017-8ef284fbd5ee" />

After some digging, I found out that google indexes a file via the "robots.txt" file that the server provides to 
the search engine.

**What is Google Indexing?**
>_Google indexing_ is the process by which Google crawls web pages, analyzes their content, and stores them
>in its searchable database. It enables those pages to appear in Google search results.

After visiting the robots.txt file we get the 3rd part of flag: ```t_0f_pl4c```.

And another hint:

Part 4 of the flag was harder than the previous 3, a bit of digging and I found that apache runs ```/.htaccess``` which
wouldnt be normally accessable unless misconfigured site. Lucky for us, we found the next part of flag:```3s_2_lO0k```

<img width="584" height="82" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/264d4ea3-8088-4779-9d7c-b9cf49958193" />

The next hint talks about mac... Well time for more digging!

Looking at the hint we got in last step, that "Store" world looked suspicious coz it was capitalzied. After some 
searching I found that ```Mac OS X/macOS stores Finder layout information (including desktop icon placement) 
within the .DS_Store file that's located inside the current directory.```

After trying to access it, we finally got the last part of flag: ```_fa04427c}```

**3. Flag**

```picoCTF{th4ts_4_l0t_0f_pl4c3s_2_lO0k_fa04427c}```
