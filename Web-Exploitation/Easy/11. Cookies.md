**Title:** Cookies

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Summary (TL;DR):**

Manipulating cookies to get our flag.

**1. Scope & Setup**

**Target:** http://mercury.picoctf.net:6418/  

**Environment:** Local System / PicoCTF VM

**Tools used:** Burpsuite(optional), Browser

**2. Exploit**

As we enter the website, we are presented with this interface:

As the title suggests, "Cookies". I went to the storage tab and saw 1 cookie called ```name= -1```.
I then changed the value to 1 and refreshed. This is what I got

<img width="820" height="251" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c664296-5d98-4ffd-828c-a9321521aef6" />


So I manually incremented the numbers until at ```name= 18``` I got the flag. 
Very Simple but annoying. 

You can either do it manually like me or with burpsuite as mentioned in this writeup:
