**Title:** IntroToBurp

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Summary (TL;DR):**

Using Burp Suite to intercept and bypass 2FA.

**1. Scope & Setup**

**Target:** http://titan.picoctf.net:PORT/

**Environment:** Local System

**Tools used:** Browser, BurpSuite

**2. Exploit**

We start off my filling in the fields presented by the website. After "forwarding" the request, we land on the 2FA
page. Here we type on any number for the OTP and send. After intercepting the request in Burp Suite, we completely 
remove the "OTP" field from the POST request and forward it.
Viola!! We have our flag!

**3. Flag**

**4. Lessons and Mitigation**

Dont rely on these stupid ways to 2FA, make it more secure.
